Walter Wemple Cruttenden III and Jeffrey James Cruttenden

The father son duo wanted to introduce micro investing to the masses, and get people 
interested in saving for their future.

Acorns has been funded mostly through venture capitol, approx. $100 million along with 
celebrity endrsoments and investments such as Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez, Bono, 
Ashton Kutcher and Kevin Durant.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Many of the younger generations do not have the wealth to invest in the stock market, 
their main focus has been to introduce small, easy to stash amounts of money into 
portfolios that can grow over time
Our mission is to look after the financial best interests of the up-and-coming, beginning
with the empowering step of micro-investing.

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The intended customer is a tech savvy customer with an eye for saving for the future,
but may not have the savings or time needed to invest heavily in the market, and may need
some hand holding. With starting deposits
of only $1, and rounding up your spare change, it is very easy to get something out there
with your name on it.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) 
Acorns was one of the first companies to ever introduce micro investing along with
robo-advisors to the general public, with rounding up your purchases to the nearest dollar
and small increment recurring deposits, before you know it you can have a sizeable "oak."

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)


## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Investments and robo-advising

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
Education is key in this realm. People nowadays have access to more information than
ever before when it comes to the stock market and how things work in the financial 
field. With the advent of the internet, people can now use their mobile devices to 
connect and automatically link accounts and save their money in places that will 
benefit them the most.

* What are the other major companies in this domain?
There are a few companies that are in this field now, Stash made a name for themselves 
copying Acorns, and most online only banking servies are starting to offer small amount
deposit investments.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Baxcked by CNBC now, they are really trying to push the average Joe to save their spare
change and any extra money, with an emphasis on educationg users in how compound
interest works and investing while younger can grow it exponentially.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
I believe the active users on the platform is one of their largest indicators of success
currently there are about 9 million active users, and the company is trying to secure a
more aggressive advertising and marketing strategy.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
While Acorns has approx 9 million users, Stash has only about 1 million. In the non 
financially knowledgeable group that would use this product, they seem to be making their 
splash. Some also use it for a set-it-and-forget-it way to just keep investments going.
Like me. :)

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I believe they could use a cash deposit option. I make tips in my job, that is not
spending money. I believe it would be a huge boon to business if you could somehow deposit
cash directly to your Invest account.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Firstly, I keep my cash just in my house. It does not increase wealth, it does not gain
interest, it does not work for me. It would help the company to drive business from an entire sector of workers that rely on cash income.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Firstly a partnership with some retailor or business that can accept it would be nessecary,
T-Mobile Money, you can deposit cash at any T-Mobile store. Secondly, the programs to 
transfer the cash directly to you invest account through routing would need to be made.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
